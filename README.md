IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis
About the Dataset

This repository contains code and analysis for binary sentiment classification on the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews. The task is to predict whether a review is positive or negative using either traditional machine learning classification methods or deep learning algorithms.
Dataset Details:

    Total reviews: 50,000
    Training set: 25,000 highly polar movie reviews
    Test set: 25,000 highly polar movie reviews
    Task: Sentiment classification (binary classification â€“ positive or negative)

The dataset has been widely used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Analytics tasks.

Project Goals

The objective of this project is to build a sentiment classifier that can accurately predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of a given movie review.
Key Tasks:

    Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
    Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.)
    Model development (using traditional classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, or deep learning algorithms such as LSTM)
    Model evaluation and comparison
